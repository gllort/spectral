 * (08/Mar/2013) Upgraded to version 3.0.
 * (12/Feb/2013) Fixed access out of range in Spectral_AddSortedN(). 
 	Also, fixed missing initializations of variables goodness* in Analysis().

 	Also added a new constructor to build the added signal.
 + (31/Jan/2013) Added routine Spectral_GetSignalSize() to the API
 * (31/Jan/2013) Spectral_AssembleSignal receives values of type spectral_value_t instead of long long int
 * (30/Jan/2013) Spectral_SerializeSignal now returns the size of the signal
 * (30/Jan/2013) Added extern "C" directives in spectral-api.h to be used from C++
